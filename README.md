# 📱 Social Hub

## 🌟 Overview

[**Social Hub**](https://resilient-faloodeh-8e9e35.netlify.app/) is a modern social media platform that redefines content discovery by categorizing posts instead of displaying a general feed. Users can explore and engage with content based on their interests, making browsing more structured and meaningful. 🚀

This project is built with **Next.js** and **Supabase**, featuring **custom authentication** and a clean UI. We are actively seeking **contributions** to expand features, especially for media uploads (photos/videos).
